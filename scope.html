				<h2 class="scope-overview"><strong>Scope Overview</strong></h2>
				<p>This section focuses on the complexity of privacy between different aspects of data protection. One must be absolute about the <span title='Extent to which individuals personal data is covered by privacy laws and regulations.'><span class='highlight'>personal</span></span>, <span title='Geographical boundaries within which data protection laws apply.'><span class='highlight'>territorial</span></span> and <span title='Specific types of data or activities that fall under the jurisdiction of data protection laws.'><span class='highlight'>material</span></span> scope of this aspect-or else one organization finds themselves compliant while another doesn't, and individuals also might not know where or how to claim their rights.<br>This section explores two relevant concepts in the personal scope context: <strong>opt-in</strong> consent mandates every participant to knowingly agree to the construction or processing of his/her data. Such terms endorse user control and emphasize data privacy.
                    In contrast, <strong>opt-out</strong> consent enables organizations to carry out the personal data collection and processing by default. An individual's option is to refuse or withdraw such consent.</p>

				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Personal Scope</strong>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Consent: <strong>opt-in</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Focus: <strong>data protection</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Summary: the LGPD requires that organizations obtain the <span title='Clear and affirmative agreement of individuals to allow the processing of their personal information.'><span class='highlight'>express consent</span></span> of individuals before processing their personal information. The law endorses the right of individuals to protect their personal information by giving them control of their data.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Consent: <strong>opt-in</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Focus: <strong>data protection</strong> (broadest scope).</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Summary: The GDPR adopts an opt-in model, placing extra weight on data protection. It is well-rounded: a wide array of personal data is concerned. It specifically forbids allowing children under 16 years of age to consent without parental approval, so the vulnerable community is more protected through the compliance program.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Consent: <strong>opt-out</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Focus: <strong>corporate freedom</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Summary: The ADPPA adopts an opt-out framework, that is, a system allowing the processing of personal data by organizations unless individuals otherwise choose to opt out. This framework favors business interests over individual privacy rights and, therefore, increases the fear of risks against personal data.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Consent: <strong>opt-in</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Focus: <strong>data protection</strong> (narrower scope).</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Summary: The Australian Privacy Act employs an opt-in approach but has a more limited application in data protection. It does not recognize a difference between the obligations for data <span title='Entities or individuals that determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.'><span class='highlight'>controllers</span></span> and <span title='Entities or individuals that process personal data on behalf of a controller.'><span class='highlight'>processors</span></span>, potentially giving rise to ambiguity in <span title='Responsibility of organizations to manage and protect personal data appropriately.'><span class='highlight'>accountability</span></span>. It doesn't restrict children from providing consent, exposing minors to risks.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Consent: <strong>opt-out</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Focus: <strong>corporate freedom</strong>.</li>
						<li class="item-title2">Summary: The CCPA utilizes an opt-out model, which consumers can opt out of having their data sold. Interestingly, it allows consent from an individual child above the age of 13. In a way, it allows minors to have some control over their personal data.</li>
					</ul>

					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Applies to any organization within the <strong>EU</strong> as well as those <strong>outside</strong> the EU that process personal data of individuals residing in the EU.

					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Applies directly to data processing activities pertaining to persons residing within the <strong>United States</strong>, making its jurisdiction slightly more localized relative to the LGPD and GDPR.</li>

					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong></li>

					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Includes <strong>sensitive personal data</strong>, but does <strong>not</strong> specifically cover <strong>employees'</strong> personal data, focusing more on consumer data protection.</li>
