				<h2 class="scope-overview"><strong>Definitions Overview</strong></h2>
				<p>This section focuses on the key concepts that provide the foundation for data reader protection laws in different jurisdictions. Each law has its own peculiarities; however, most use similar nomenclature in referring to the provisions regarding their processing and protection of data. Terms included are <strong>Personal Data</strong>, <strong>Sensitive Data</strong>, and the roles of data <strong>controllers</strong> and <strong>processors</strong>. Within this context, terms are clarified to help the reader attain an overall understanding of how these laws govern data protection and privacy.<br>For example, <strong>Personal Data</strong> means any information that identifies or can be used to identify an individual, whereas <strong>Sensitive Data</strong> means any information that needs special protection on account of its sensitive nature.</p>

				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Responsible for Data Processing</strong>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">In the context of the LGPD, the <strong>controller</strong> and the <strong>operator</strong> are the main entities responsible for processing personal data, while the <strong>data protection officer</strong> (DPO) plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance. The controller determines the purpose and means of data processing; the operator, on behalf of the controller, processes data; and the data protection officer presides over the issues of data protection policies and liaises with the <span title='Regulatory body established by the LGPD to oversee and enforce data protection laws in Brazil.'><span class='highlight'>National Data Protection Authority (ANPD)</span></span>.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">The GDPR identifies different roles involved in personal data processing, including the <strong>controller</strong> (the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data), <strong>processor</strong> (the entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller), and the <strong>DPO</strong> oversees compliance with data protection laws and the processes for securely processing personal data within an organization.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">In the context of the ADPPA, the entities responsible for data processing are categorized as <strong>covered entities</strong> and <strong>service providers</strong>. Covered entities refer to organizations or businesses that collect, process, or transfer covered data, which pertains to identifiable individuals while service providers are entities that process data on behalf of covered entities.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Under the Australian Privacy Act, the primary entities responsible for data processing are known as <strong>APP Entities</strong> (Australian Privacy Principles Entities). These are the organizations or agencies that must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and typically include federal agencies and certain other private sector organizations considered responsible for the processing of personal data in compliance with the provisions of the Act.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">The California Consumer Privacy Act separates the data controller from the data processor. Under the CCPA, <strong>businesses</strong> are the entities that collect, use, or disclose the personal information of California consumers, whereas the <strong>service provider</strong> is defined as an entity that processes this information on behalf of the company. Both must adhere to the CCPA regulations regarding the transparency in how they deal with the personal data.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Personal Data</strong>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">According to the LGPD, personal data refers to any <strong>information related to an identified or identifiable individual</strong>. Such broad definitions ensure that data from the simplest to the fairly complex ranges, including includes names, identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of an individual, is put under the protection of the law.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Personal data are those that are <strong>linked to identifiable natural persons</strong> under the GDPR. This may include name, identification number, location data, or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that person. The regulation concerns any information that is capable of identifying someone in being either directly or indirectly.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">The ADPPA defines covered data as any <strong>information related to an identified or identifiable natural person</strong>. Such covered data encompasses a fairly broad category of information that could directly or indirectly identify a particular person; for example, names, contact information, or online identifiers. </li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">According to the Australian law, personal data represents any <strong>information that is about an individual</strong> and is held by a federal agency or an APP entity. This is a quite broad definition and it certainly includes information pointing or probably pointing directly or indirectly to an individual such as names, contact details, or identification numbers, and opinion or inferences about the individual.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">The CCPA defines personal data broadly as any <strong>information that identifies, describes, or can be associated with a consumer or their family</strong>. This broad definition includes names, addresses, email addresses, information regarding a consumer's browsing history, purchase records, or even inferences drawn about the preferences or behavior of the consumer. One of the main objectives of the CCPA is to allow consumers some control over their personal information, as it informs them regarding the information that is collected, the purpose for which it is intended, and how it is being utilized.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Sensitive Data</strong>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Sensitive data is defined under the LGPD as a subset of personal data, particularly those that could reveal <strong>racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political opinions, membership in unions or religious, philosophical, or political organizations, health or sex life, genetic or biometric data</strong>. Such protection assures privacy and better dignity in respect to the evolving ground threats.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Sensitive data, or special categories of personal data under the GDPR, refers to more delicate types of information that require additional protection. The information concerned with a person's <strong>racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union, genetic data, biometric data concerning an individual, health-related information, or concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation</strong> is classified as sensitive data.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Sensitive data under the ADPPA has been designated as sensitive covered data, which is any personal information that is particularly at risk of misuse or, if mismanaged, could result in significant injury. It includes such information as <strong>racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, biometric information, and health-related information</strong>. The ADPPA establishes more stringent regulations over sensitive covered data and generally requires the express consent of the affected individual prior to its collection or use.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Sensitive data includes any information about an individual that is held by a federal agency. This information provides higher protection considering its sensitive nature; such details may relate to a person's <strong>racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or health information</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Sensitive data under the CCPA includes information that identifies, describes, or can be associated with a consumer or their family, much like personal data. However, it is a specific class that are mostly information types that if publicly disclosed would create very serious risks of harming privacy. These could include data types about a consumer's <strong>geolocation data, race/ethnicity, religious or political beliefs, health, and financial data</strong>, so the CCPA allows consumers to consumers limit the usage of sensitive information because of different rights.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="scope-title"><strong>Data Processor</strong>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>LGPD:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Processors under the LGPD are considered any entities who process personal data in the name of the controller, that is, the <strong>operator</strong>. They do not dictate for the purposes of data collection, but allow for the safe handling of data and compliance with such law on the part of data protection.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>GDPR:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">A Processor under the GDPR is defined exactly as a <strong>processor</strong>, that is, an entity, whether it be a natural or legal person, that processes personal data on behalf of a controller. Direct obligations placed on processors include maintenance of records for processing activities, and the processors must implement appropriate security measures. </li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>ADPPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">A data processor, under the provision of the ADPPA, is defined as a <strong>service provider</strong>, that is, any person or legal entity that processes data on behalf of a covered entity. Their role is to assist covered entities in the management of personal data; however, they themselves must adopt the strictest security parameters to avoid any unauthorized access or breaches. </li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>Australian Privacy Act:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">Unlike other privacy laws, the Australian Privacy Act <strong>does not specifically distinguish</strong> between controllers and processors in the same way. The focus is primarily on federal agencies and APP entities as controllers of personal data, with no explicit reference to data processors. Therefore, in regular instances, the agency or the entity holding the data shall be responsible for its processing, thereby reducing the incidence of official third-party data processors. </li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="item-group">
						<li class="item-title"><strong>CCPA:</strong></li>
						<li class="item-title2">The data processor under the CCPA is referred to as a <strong>service provider</strong>, which is any entity that processes personal information on behalf of a business. Service providers are bound by contracts with businesses and required to conform their use and disclosure of data to detailed guidelines. That means, service providers cannot use personal information for their own purposes beyond what is stipulated by the business they serve </li>
